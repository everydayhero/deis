- Move any `deis open issues`_ from the current release to the next milestone
- Close the current `deis milestone`_
- Update CHANGELOG.md using the `changelog script`_
    * ``./contrib/util/generate-changelog.sh vU.V.W vX.Y.Z | cat - CHANGELOG.md > tmp && mv tmp CHANGELOG.md``
      substituting the previous release for vU.V.W and the current one for vX.Y.Z.
    * proofread the new CHANGELOG.md to ensure it was generated correctly
    * ``git add CHANGELOG.md && git commit -m "docs(CHANGELOG): update for v.X.Y.Z"``
- Merge git master into release branch locally
    * ``git checkout release && git merge master``
- Edit contrib/coreos/user-data and update ``DEIS_RELEASE`` to ":vX.Y.Z"
- Commit and push the deis/deis release and tag
    * remove "-dev" from __version__ fields in Python packages
    * remove "-dev" from Version constant in version/version.go
    * ``git commit -a -m 'chore(release): update version to vX.Y.Z'``

- At the Docker Hub, create an automatic tagged build ":vX.Y.Z" for every component
